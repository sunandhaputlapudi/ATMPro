**ATMPro** is a Java-based simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system.  
This project demonstrates core banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing funds, depositing, and transaction history — all through a console or GUI interface (adjust as appropriate).

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Key Features:**
- Secure login authentication using account number and PIN
- Check account balance
- Cash withdrawal
- Deposit funds
- View simple transaction history
- Modular code structure for easier readability and future enhancements
